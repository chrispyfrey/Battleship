This program implements a version of the Battleship game.

The Gameboard on the left shows the placement of your 
ships as read from the ship_placement.csv file and the 
shots of your opponent. If one of you ships is hit, the
ships identifying character is changed to a o's. If your
opponent's shot missed, its location is displayed as an
"x".

The Shotboard on the right shows your shots. If you hit
one of your opponent's ships, the placement of that ship
is represented on your Shotboard by o's. Your misses 
are displayed on your Shotboard by x's.

It only takes one hit on a ship to sink that ship.

Your opponent's Gameboard and Shotboard are displayed
at the conclusion of the game.

The game may be played again without exiting the program.

Semi-specific error output is displayed in the event that
there is an error encountered while reading the provided
ship data file.

The game may be exited during shot coordinate input by
entering 'q' or 'Q'.
