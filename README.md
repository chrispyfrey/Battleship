# Fall 2017 CSCI-2312 Object Oriented Programming Final Project

This program implements a version of the Battleship game.

The Gameboard on the left shows the placement of your ships as read from the ship_placement.csv file and the shots of your opponent. If one of your ships is hit, the ships identifying character is changed to o's. If your opponent's shot missed, its location is displayed as an "x".

The shotboard on the right shows your shots. If you hit one of your opponent's ships, the placement of that ship is represented on your shotboard by o's. Your misses are displayed on your shotboard by x's.

It only takes one hit to sink a ship.

Your opponent's gameboard and shotboard are displayed at the conclusion of the game.

The game may be restarted without exiting the program.

Output is displayed in the event that there is an error encountered while reading the provided ship data .csv file.

The game may be exited during shot coordinate input by entering 'q' or 'Q'.
